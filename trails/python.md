> The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

> Beautiful is better than ugly.
> Explicit is better than implicit.
> Simple is better than complex.
> Complex is better than complicated.
> Flat is better than nested.
> Sparse is better than dense.
> Readability counts.
> Special cases aren’t special enough to break the rules.
> Although practicality beats purity.
> Errors should never pass silently.
> Unless explicitly silenced.
> In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
> There should be one– and preferably only one –obvious way to do it.
> Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you’re Dutch.
> Now is better than never.
> Although never is often better than right now.
> If the implementation is hard to explain, it’s a bad idea.
> If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
> Namespaces are one honking great idea – let’s do more of those!
